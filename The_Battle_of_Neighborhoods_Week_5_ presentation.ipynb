Bars are usually co-localized with other businesses like restaurants, dancing clubs and other bars as well. This is why many cities have bars that are spatially clustered together in some streets, neighborhoods or districts. I want to identify these clusters in major cities around the world and where they are located. Moreover, I will extract useful information for the bar industry, in order to offer optimum location options to investors who want to invest in this type of business. In this report I am performing an analysis for Toronto city in Canada.\n"

Location data from Wikipedia, Foursquare and Geospatial Data was gathered, cleaned and combined. Then, clustering and frequency analyses were used to determine the options to be presented for the client. The venues and clusters were represented on a Toronto's map and frequency data were represented in bar plots and tables."

            "source": "First, I extracted from Wikipedia the Toronto boroughs, neighbourhoods and postal codes [1]. Data was cleaned and transformed into a Pandas Dataframe, which was later  subjected to more cleaning. Geospatial data was downloaded [2] to link Toronto's postal codes to coordinates (latitude and longitude). Then, venues in a radius of 500 m from each neighbourhood location in Toronto were collected into a Dataframe using Foursquare API. This dataframe was then filtered using keywords from the 'Venue Category' column and further categorized into three broader categories (Drinks, Foods and Music). \n\nTo visualize these data, the venues were represented in a Folium map, coloring each venue according to their broad category. In order to capture the spatial clustering of the venues using their coordinates, a K-means unsupervised algorithm was used testing different cluster numbers. A graphical analysis plotting the distance error (sum of squared distances to the clusters) versus the number of clusters was used in the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters. Once the optimal cluster number was selected (9), the clusters were represented in a Folium map and color coded according to their cluster label. This clustering strategy was not efficient in finding compact clusters, for this reason the DBSCAN algorithm was used instead. The clustering was optimized by iterating between clustering using this algorithm with different epsilon values and a fixed minimum value of 10 members per cluster. This last value was selected because I considered it to be a reasonable minimum number of businesses located in a single street. The epsilon ranged between 0.01 and 0.1, which gave clusters ranging in sizes from very small to very big as visualized in a Folium map after each clusterization round. I selected the epsilon 0.6 which gave the best spatial clustering in my opinion because all clusters were small enough to be walked from end to end but not so small that they overlapped too much. \n\nFor each cluster, the alpha shape polygon (concave hull / outer path) and encompassed area were calculated. The relative frequencies of the broad categories for each cluster was calculated after one hot encoding. Bar plot representations were performed of the total venues, areas and relative frequencies of venues per cluster.  In case the client would like to know more about the different venues in each cluster, the frequencies of Foursquare venues were analyzed and reported."

By colecting from  the city's neighbourhoods venues relevant to this business, and later clustering them using the DBSCAN algorithm it was possible to detect 14 clusters. The clusters are more concentrated in the central area of the city. \n\nThe size of the clusters was highly variable as shown in the total amount of venues per cluster, ranging from 10 to more than 300 and in the cluster areas determination. There are some clusters more enriched in bars and pubs, like cluster number 10, while others seems to be predominanlty populated by food venues. Music venues seems to be scarce and only the cluster 6 present music venues.\n\nThe client will be able to select in which part of the city he/she whishes to invest in a bar according to this findings.
