It is common that people like to go to bars that have other bars nearby beacuase they can esaily move from one bar just by walking. This is why many cities have bars that are spatially clustered together. I want to identify these clusters in different major cities arround the world and in which neigborhoods they are located. By comparing them and extracting usefull information for the bar industry, I will offer location options to investors who want to invest in this area of business.     \n"
